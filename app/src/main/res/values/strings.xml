        iGEM est la plus grande compétition internationale de Biologie de Synthèse et a pour but
        de lier éducation et compétition afin de faire progresser la recherche dans ce secteur.
        Organisée par le MIT depuis 2004, des étudiants du monde entier s’affrontent
        en créant des projets innovants dans le domaine de la biologie de synthèse.\n\n
        Au début de l’été, les équipes reçoivent un kit de composants biologiques
        et travaillent au laboratoire afin de concevoir des circuits génétiques synthétiques
        qui devront fonctionner dans des cellules vivantes. La collaboration et l’échange
        entre les différentes équipes sont valorisés,
        dans cette optique de progression de la biologie de synthèse.

\n
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the\n

        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such\n
        Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or\n
        counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes\n
        direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that\n
        Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n

        with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n
\n
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n
\n
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n
\n
        © You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,\n
        trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain\n
        to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n
\n
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You\n
        distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding\n
        those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:\n
        within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,\n
        if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational\n
        purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works\n
        that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional\n
        attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n
\n
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license\n

\n
        Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product\n
        names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work\n

        (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\n
        KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,\n
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for\n
        determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your\n
        exercise of permissions under this License.\n

        contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or\n
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,\n
        special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the\n
        use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,\n
        computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n
\n
        Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may\n
        choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability\n
        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You\n
        agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted\n
        against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n
        stating that You changed the files; and\n
        \n
        © You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n

        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n

        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n

        \n
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n

        the conditions stated in this License.\n
        \n
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n
        \n
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n

        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n
        \n
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
        \n
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n

        Notre équipe, IONIS Paris, a développé un projet en deux parties autour de la vulgarisation scientifique
        pour la compétition iGEM 2015.  La première partie consiste à créer une bio-console,
        un dispositif reliant le réel au virtuel. La bio-console IONIS Paris est composée de :\n
        • une puce de microfluidique\n
        • un microscope\n
        • un ordinateur\n
        • une manette\n\n

        Sur l’écran d’ordinateur, le joueur peut visualiser une bactérie fluorescente et contrôler ses mouvements
        grâce à la manette. La bactérie est intégrée dans la puce microfluidique préalablement construite sous
        forme de labyrinthe et agrandie via le microscope relié à l’ordinateur.\n\n

        La deuxième partie de notre projet est l’application mobile Bact’Man proposant plusieurs jeux
        autour des concepts de biotechnologie et de biologie de synthèse.
        Ces jeux ont pour but de familiariser le grand public à ces grands concepts.
        Notre philosophie : “Comprendre et apprendre tout en s\'amusant”.

        La biologie de synthèse est l’ingénierie de la biologie.
        Elle vise à la conception rationnelle de systèmes fondés sur le vivant
        ou inspiré du vivant,et dotés de fonction absentes dans la nature.
        Ce domaine en pleine émergence pourra faire progresser nos connaissances du monde vivant
        et permettra de développer de nombreuses applications industrielles
        dans le domaine de la santé ou de l’environnement par exemple.\n\n
        Cependant, et comme toute nouvelle technologie,
        la biologie de synthèse soulève optimisme et enthousiasme, mais aussi inquiétude et méfiance.

    <string-array name="glossary_texts">
        <item>DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) is a huge molecule that contains all information necessary for the proper functioning of the body.\n\n
            Present in all of human body cells, DNA is also present in all other organisms (plants, birds, insects, bacteria).\n\n
            It is this molecule that makes us all unique individuals with different characteristics.</item>
        <item>Replication is the biological process that occurs during cell division.\n\n
            During this process, DNA will be copied in two identical copies.\n
            Therefore, two daughter cells each with DNA from a mother cell will be obtained after this process.</item>
        <item>A nucleotide is a principal constituent of the DNA. It is itself composed of three elements:\n\n
            • A nitrogen base\n
            • A ribose (sugar)\n
            • A phosphate\n\n
            There are 4 basic nucleotides constituting the DNA code: A (Adenine), T (Thymine), C (Cytosine) and G (Guanine).</item>
        <item>DNA is a double helix strand.\n\n
            Imagine a railroad where each side (the bases) must be assembled by complementarity!\n\n
            A and T are assembled together, and C and G together.
        </item>
        <item>A plasmid is a circular DNA present in addition to the chromosomal DNA of the bacterium.\n\n
            It can be transmitted from one bacterium to another and confers new properties to the receiving bacteria (resistance to an antibiotic, for example).
        </item>
        <item>It is a specific part of DNA that is recognized by an enzyme, called restriction enzyme, which cuts DNA at this location.\n\n
            Picture yourself the enzyme as a pair of scissors that can only cut DNA at these sites! This process is called digestion.\n
            There are several enzymes and therefore multiple sites in a single DNA.\n\n


            There are 2 different kinds of digestion:\n
            • Digestion with blunt ends\n\n
            • Digestion with sticky ends
        </item>
        <item>Ligation occurs after digestion.\nIt allows you to stick or stick back together two strands of DNA compatible together.\n\n
            The enzyme that allows ligation is called Ligase.</item>
        <item>BioBricks are fragments of standardized DNA, created to engineer simpler construction of biological systems.\n\n
            Each BioBrick is delimited by universal prefixes and suffixes, they thus begin and end all in the same way.\n
            As they are designed on the same model, we can assemble them like "LEGO" and then incorporate them into a living cell.\n\n
            This standards allows iGEM teams around the world to work together as all work with the same standards.
        </item>
        <item>It is a round plastic box, cover by a lid. Petri dishes are used to make micro-organism cultures (bacteria, fungi etc.).\n\n
            In order to grow, micro-organisms needs a suitable culture medium that is introduced in such a box.</item>
        <item>This method allows the separation of proteins, DNA or RNA according to their molecular weight.\n
            These DNA / RNA / protein are previously prepared and then deposited in a gel. This gel is then placed in a special liquid and then subjected to an electric current which enables the separation of molecules.\n\n
            The smaller, the molecule is, the faster it will migrate on the gel.</item>
        <item>Transcription operates thanks to a mechanism similar to the process of replication, however it does not concern any DNA!\n\n
            In fact, transcription involve the replication of specific DNA areas. These zones are surrounded by promoters and terminators.\n
            Promoters are sequences that play a regulatory role and that fixes the necessary machinery for replication whereas the terminator marks the end of the sequence to be transcribed.\n
            RNA, the molecule obtained by transcription, is complementary to the DNA and chemically very close to it, except for some details.\n
            In RNA, we find the same bases as in DNA except for thymine, replaced by uracil (T becomes U)!\n\n
            Once formed, RNA will undergo some changes during maturation to be ready for his translation into protein.</item>
        <item>Translation is the process of converting genetic information into functional proteins.\n
            Indeed, RNA create from DNA contains all the data needed to create proteins, it only remains to decrypt this information!\n\n
            A protein called ribosome is responsible for decoding. After being fixed to the RNA strand, the ribosome will read the nucleic acid sequence by creating "words" of three nucleic acids each.\n
            These words, called codons, will then be recognized and translated into amino acid to form a protein. As a language translator, the ribosome associates the word to its equivalent in protein language. The dictionary used is called genetic code.\n
            During this process, the amino acid "read" are attached to each other like a pearl necklace.\n\n
            Once finished reading the amino acid chain is released.\n
            She then fold up to adopt its structure and function before finally fulfill its role in its orgaism.
        </item>
        <item>A mutation is a modification in the DNA sequence. This modification can occur naturally, by errors during replication for example, or be induced by mutagens or phenomena said. For example, UV damages DNA and induce mutations.\n\n
            If these changes are essential for the evolution and the diversity, some variations can also have several consequences for the living organism.\n
            Some are positive and confer a benefit to the organization, such as a better metabolism, while others are harmless or even harmful. Indeed, if a mutation can allow better functioning of a protein, it can also alter its function and make it ineffective.\n\n
            There are different types of variations:\n\n

            • Insertions, where one or more nucleotides are added\n
            • The deletions, in which one or several nucleotides are deleted existing\n
            • Substitutions, where one or more bases are replaced with other\n\n

            How these small changes can have such great consequences?\n\n
            When translating the genetic information is cut into 3-letter words, the codons.\n
            The translation of this codon is then looked-up in a "dictionary", the genetic code to translate this word into protein language.\n
            If one of the letters change or if the words are not separated the same way, the translation into a protein will be altered.\n
            Fortunately, all mutations are far from harmful! The majority of them do not even have direct consequences because of the redundancy of the genetic code: among codons, there are many synonyms, so even if a base changes, the translation may remain correct.\n\n

            The mutations also allow genetic diversity: if we do not have all the eyes of the same color, it is due to individuals not having all the same genes and the same mutations!
        </item>
        <item>A vitamin is an organic substance needed in small amounts for the metabolism of a living organism. It can’t be synthesized in sufficient quantities by the organism.\n\n
            They are therefore considered essential supplements. Vitamins are classified into two groups: water-soluble vitamins (water-soluble) and lipid-soluble vitamins (fat soluble).

            The essential role of a vitamin is a transfer from one molecule to another, of an electron, an atom or group of atoms to another.\n\n

            • Inadequate intake or absence of vitamin causes many diseases such as scurvy, rachitis etc.\n
            • Excessive intake of vitamins can also cause diseases such as hypervitaminosis, very toxic to the body.\n\n

            Vitamin requirements are difficult to establish because they vary with the age, sex, size and muscular activity.\n
            They increase during growth or diseases. In women, the need for vitamins increases during pregnancy and lactation.</item>
        <item>A virus is a biological entity that requires a host, usually a cell, for whom it uses the metabolism and its constituents to replicate and live.</item>
        <item>Phage or Bacteriophage are viruses that infect bacteria. They are usually very specific and often can infect only one species of bacteria.\n\n
            This specificity is due to their mechanism of penetration into the bacterial cell: the phages recognize specific receptors on the bacterial surface which allow them to attach and inject their genetic material into the bacterium.\n\n

            Phages are unable to reproduce on their own. They do it by injecting their genetic material into a bacteria which has the enzymes and the ribosomes needed to replicate and translate its genetic information, the viral genome can therefore be translated and replicated to form many copies of the virus.\n
            These viruses are then released from the bacteria by a host bacterium lysis mechanism, lysis being a membrane disintegrating mechanism of cell killing of the cell.
        </item>
        <item>An antibiotic is a natural or synthetic substance that blocks the growth or destroys bacteria.\n\n
            They act specifically on bacteria by selectively blocking one step in an essential mechanism for their development and survival. (Synthesis of their wall, DNA, proteins, etc.)\n
            This blocking occurs when the antibiotic binds to its target (receptor).\n\n
            This interaction between the antibiotic and its target is very selective and specific bacteria.</item>
