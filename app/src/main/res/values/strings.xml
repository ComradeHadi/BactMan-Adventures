        iGEM is the biggest international competition of Synthetic Biology, and aims to connect education and
        competition to advance research in this area.
        Organised by the MIT since 2004, students from the whole world compete by creating innovative projects
        in the field of Synthetic Biology.\n
        \nAt the beginning of summer, the teams receive a kit of biologic parts and work in the laboratory to design
        synthetic genetical circuits that must function in living cells. Collaboration and exchange between teams
        is highly valued, in this perspective of advancing Synthetic Biology.

        \n
        \n"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
        \n
        \n"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License,
        as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        \n
        \n"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the
        Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
        whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include
        works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
        Derivative Works thereof.
        \n
        \n"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any
        modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to
        Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to
        submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
        verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
        managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
        communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not
        a Contribution."
        \n
        \n"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has
        been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        \n
        \nGrant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
        grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
        reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        \n
        \nGrant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
        to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this

        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which
        such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
        constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
        License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        \n
        \nRedistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
        medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following
        conditions:
        \n
        \n(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        © You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent,
        trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
        \n
        \n(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
        distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
        following places:\n
        \nwithin a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
        Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
        Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
        \n
        \nYou may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different
        license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
        with the conditions stated in this License.
        \n
        \nSubmission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
        for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
        without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        \n
        \nTrademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or
        product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
        the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        \n
        \nDisclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work
        (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
        ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
        determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
        exercise of permissions under this License.
        \n
        \nLimitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
        contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
        agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
        special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
        the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
        computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        \n
        \nAccepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You
        may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
        obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
        only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
        agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
        against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        \nFree Art License 1.3 (FAL 1.3)
        \n
        \nPreamble
        \n
        \nThe Free Art License grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and transform creative works without
        infringing the author’s rights.
        \n
        \nThe Free Art License recognizes and protects these rights. Their implementation has been reformulated
        in order to allow everyone to use creations of the human mind in a creative manner,
        regardless of their types and ways of expression.
        \n
        \nWhile the public’s access to creations of the human mind usually is restricted by the implementation
        of copyright law, it is favoured by the Free Art License. This license intends to allow the use of a work’s
        resources; to establish new conditions for creating in order to increase creation opportunities.
        The Free Art License grants the right to use a work, and acknowledges the right holder’s
        and the user’s rights and responsibility.
        \n
        \nThe invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and Free Software have changed
        creation methods: creations of the human mind can obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed.
        They allow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the benefit of all.
        \n
        \nThe main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect these creations of the human mind
        according to the principles of copyleft: freedom to use, copy, distribute, transform,
        and prohibition of exclusive appropriation.
        \n
        \nDefinitions
        \n
        \n« work » either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the common work as defined hereafter:
        \n
        \n« common work » means a work composed of the initial work and all subsequent contributions to it
        (originals and copies). The initial author is the one who, by choosing this license, defines the conditions
        under which contributions are made.
        \n
        \n« Initial work » means the work created by the initiator of the common work (as defined above),
        the copies of which can be modified by whoever wants to.
        \n
        \n« Subsequent works » means the contributions made by authors who participate in the evolution of
        the common work by exercising the rights to reproduce, distribute, and modify that are granted by the license.
        \n
        \n« Originals » (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of either the initial work
        or any subsequent work mentioning a date and used by their author(s) as references for any subsequent updates,
        interpretations, copies or reproductions.
        \n
        \n« Copy » means any reproduction of an original as defined by this license.
        \n
        \n1. OBJECT
        \nThe aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one can use this work freely.
        \n
        \n2. SCOPE
        \nThis work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author specifies the extent
        to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.
        \n
        \n2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS)
        \nYou have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any other person,
        whatever the technique used.
        \n
        \n2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC
        \nYou have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified or not,
        whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge, provided that you:
        \nattach this license without any modification to the copies of this work or indicate precisely
        where the license can be found,
        \nspecify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the originals,
        including yours if you have modified the work,
        \nspecify to the recipient where to access the originals (either initial or subsequent).
        \nThe authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right to distribute the originals
        under the same conditions as the copies.
        \n
        \n2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY
        \nYou have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial or subsequent)
        provided you comply with the following conditions:
        \nall conditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;
        \nindicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what kind of modifications have been made;
        \ndistribute the subsequent work under the same license or any compatible license.
        \nThe author(s) of the original work may give you the right to modify it
        under the same conditions as the copies.
        \n
        \n3. RELATED RIGHTS
        \nActivities giving rise to author’s rights and related rights shall not challenge the rights
        granted by this license.
        \nFor example, this is the reason why performances must be subject to the same license or a compatible license.
        Similarly, integrating the work in a database, a compilation or an anthology shall not prevent anyone from using
        the work under the same conditions as those defined in this license.
        \n
        \n4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK
        \nIncorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the Free Art License shall not challenge
        the rights granted by this license.
        \nIf the work can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in which it is incorporated,
        then incorporation shall only be allowed under the condition that the larger work is subject either
        to the Free Art License or a compatible license.
        \n
        \n5. COMPATIBILITY
        \nA license is compatible with the Free Art License provided:
        \nit gives the right to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including for commercial purposes
        and without any other restrictions than those required by the respect of the other compatibility criteria;
        \nit ensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to previous versions of the work
        when possible;
        \nit recognizes the Free Art License as compatible (reciprocity);
        \nit requires that changes made to the work be subject to the same license or to a license
        which also meets these compatibility criteria.
        \n
        \n6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS
        \nThis license does not aim at denying your author’s rights in your contribution or any related right.
        By choosing to contribute to the development of this common work, you only agree to grant others the same rights
        with regard to your contribution as those you were granted by this license.
        Conferring these rights does not mean you have to give up your intellectual rights.
        \n
        \n7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
        \nThe freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right to copy, distribute, modify) implies
        that everyone is responsible for their own actions.
        \n
        \n8. DURATION OF THE LICENSE
        \nThis license takes effect as of your acceptance of its terms. The act of copying, distributing, or modifying
        the work constitutes a tacit agreement.
        This license will remain in effect for as long as the copyright which is attached to the work.
        If you do not respect the terms of this license, you automatically lose the rights that it confers.
        \nIf the legal status or legislation to which you are subject makes it impossible for you to respect
        the terms of this license, you may not make use of the rights which it confers.
        \n
        \n9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE
        \nThis license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate improvements by its authors
        (instigators of the « Copyleft Attitudeâ€ movement) by way of new, numbered versions.
        \nYou will always have the choice of accepting the terms contained in the version under which the copy
        of the work was distributed to you, or alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent versions.
        \n
        \n10. SUB-LICENSING
        \nSub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to make use of the rights that it confers
        will be directly bound to the authors of the common work.
        \n
        \n11. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
        \nThis license is written with respect to both French law and the Berne Convention
        for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.

        Our Team, IONIS Paris, developed a two part project around scientific popularisation for the iGEM 2015
        competition. The first part consists in a Bio-Console, a device connecting the living with the digital.
        The IONIS Paris bio-console is composed of:
        \n• a microfluidic chip
        \n• a microscope
        \n• a computer
        \n• a joystick
        \n
        \nOn the computer screen, the player can visualise a fluorescent bacterium and control its move with the
        joystick. The bacterium is integrated in the microfluidic chip build beforehand in a maze shape, and is
        enlarged via the microscope linked to the computer.
        \n
        \nThe second part of our project is the mobile application BactMan Adventures, offering several games on the
        concepts of biotechnology and synthetic biology.
        \n
        \nThose games aim at familiarising general public with those big concepts.
        \nOur philosophy: “Understand and learn while having fun”.

        Synthetic biology is biological engineering.
        \nIts aim is the rational design of systems based on the living or inspired by the living,
        and endowed with functions inexistent in nature.
        \nThis emerging field will push forward our knowledge of the living world and will enable the development
        of several industrial applications in areas such as the health sector or the environmental field.
        \n
        \nHowever, as with all technologies, synthetic biology raises optimism and enthousiasm, but also worry and
        wariness.

    <string-array name="glossary_texts" formatted="false">
        <item>DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) is a huge molecule that contains all information necessary for the proper
            functioning of the body.
            \n
            \nPresent in all of human body cells, DNA is also present in all other organisms (plants, birds, insects,
            bacteria).
            \n
            \nIt is this molecule that makes us all unique individuals with different characteristics.
        </item>
        <item>Replication is the biological process that occurs during cell division.
            \n
            \nDuring this process, DNA will be copied in two identical copies.
            \nTherefore, two daughter cells each with DNA from a mother cell will be obtained after this process.
        </item>
        <item>A nucleotide is a principal constituent of the DNA. It is itself composed of three elements:
            \n
            \n• A nitrogen base
            \n• A ribose (sugar)
            \n• A phosphate
            \n
            \nThere are 4 basic nucleotides constituting the DNA code: A (Adenine), T (Thymine), C (Cytosine) and G
            (Guanine).
        </item>
        <item>DNA is a double helix strand.
            \n
            \nImagine a railroad where each side (the bases) must be assembled by complementarity!
            \n
            \nA and T are assembled together, and C and G together.
        </item>
        <item>A plasmid is a circular DNA present in addition to the chromosomal DNA of the bacterium.
            \n
            \nIt can be transmitted from one bacterium to another and confers new properties to the receiving bacteria
            (resistance to an antibiotic, for example).
        </item>
        <item>It is a specific part of DNA that is recognized by an enzyme, called restriction enzyme, which cuts DNA at
            this location.
            \n
            \nPicture yourself the enzyme as a pair of scissors that can only cut DNA at these sites! This process is
            called digestion.
            \nThere are several enzymes and therefore multiple sites in a single DNA.
            \n
            \nThere are 2 different kinds of digestion:
            \n• Digestion with blunt ends
            \n
            \n• Digestion with sticky ends
        </item>
        <item>Ligation occurs after digestion.\nIt allows you to stick or stick back together two strands of DNA
            compatible together.
            \n
            \nThe enzyme that allows ligation is called Ligase.
        </item>
        <item>BioBricks are fragments of standardized DNA, created to engineer simpler construction of biological
            systems.
            \n
            \nEach BioBrick is delimited by universal prefixes and suffixes, they thus begin and end all in the same
            way.
            \nAs they are designed on the same model, we can assemble them like "LEGO" and then incorporate them into a
            living cell.
            \n
            \nThis standards allows iGEM teams around the world to work together as all work with the same standards.
        </item>
        <item>It is a round plastic box, cover by a lid. Petri dishes are used to make micro-organism cultures
            (bacteria, fungi etc.).
            \n
            \nIn order to grow, micro-organisms needs a suitable culture medium that is introduced in such a box.
        </item>
        <item>This method allows the separation of proteins, DNA or RNA according to their molecular weight.
            \nThese DNA / RNA / protein are previously prepared and then deposited in a gel. This gel is then placed in
            a
            special liquid and then subjected to an electric current which enables the separation of molecules.
            \n
            \nThe smaller, the molecule is, the faster it will migrate on the gel.
        </item>
        <item>Transcription operates thanks to a mechanism similar to the process of replication, however it does not
            concern any DNA!
            \n
            \nIn fact, transcription involve the replication of specific DNA areas. These zones are surrounded by
            promoters and terminators.
            \nPromoters are sequences that play a regulatory role and that fixes the necessary machinery for
            replication
            whereas the terminator marks the end of the sequence to be transcribed.
            \nRNA, the molecule obtained by transcription, is complementary to the DNA and chemically very close to it,
            except for some details.
            \nIn RNA, we find the same bases as in DNA except for thymine, replaced by uracil (T becomes U)!
            \n
            \nOnce formed, RNA will undergo some changes during maturation to be ready for his translation into
            protein.
        </item>
        <item>Translation is the process of converting genetic information into functional proteins.
            \nIndeed, RNA create from DNA contains all the data needed to create proteins, it only remains to decrypt
            this
            information!
            \n
            \nA protein called ribosome is responsible for decoding. After being fixed to the RNA strand, the ribosome
            will read the nucleic acid sequence by creating "words" of three nucleic acids each.
            \nThese words, called codons, will then be recognized and translated into amino acid to form a protein. As
            a
            language translator, the ribosome associates the word to its equivalent in protein language. The dictionary
            used is called genetic code.
            \nDuring this process, the amino acid "read" are attached to each other like a pearl necklace.
            \n
            \nOnce finished reading the amino acid chain is released.
            \nShe then fold up to adopt its structure and function before finally fulfill its role in its orgaism.
        </item>
        <item>A mutation is a modification in the DNA sequence. This modification can occur naturally, by errors during
            replication for example, or be induced by mutagens or phenomena said. For example, UV damages DNA and induce
            mutations.
            \n
            \nIf these changes are essential for the evolution and the diversity, some variations can also have several
            consequences for the living organism.
            \nSome are positive and confer a benefit to the organization, such as a better metabolism, while others are
            harmless or even harmful. Indeed, if a mutation can allow better functioning of a protein, it can also alter
            its function and make it ineffective.
            \n
            \nThere are different types of variations:
            \n
            \n• Insertions, where one or more nucleotides are added
            \n• The deletions, in which one or several nucleotides are deleted existing
            \n• Substitutions, where one or more bases are replaced with other
            \n
            \nHow these small changes can have such great consequences?
            \n
            \nWhen translating the genetic information is cut into 3-letter words, the codons.
            \nThe translation of this codon is then looked-up in a "dictionary", the genetic code to translate this
            word
            into protein language.
            \nIf one of the letters change or if the words are not separated the same way, the translation into a
            protein
            will be altered.
            \nFortunately, all mutations are far from harmful! The majority of them do not even have direct
            consequences
            because of the redundancy of the genetic code: among codons, there are many synonyms, so even if a base
            changes, the translation may remain correct.
        \n
            \n
            The mutations also allow genetic diversity: if we do not have all the eyes of the same color, it is due to
            individuals not having all the same genes and the same mutations!
        </item>
        <item>A vitamin is an organic substance needed in small amounts for the metabolism of a living organism. It
            can’t be synthesized in sufficient quantities by the organism.
            \n
            \nThey are therefore considered essential supplements. Vitamins are classified into two groups:
            water-soluble
            vitamins (water-soluble) and lipid-soluble vitamins (fat soluble). The essential role of a vitamin is a
            transfer from one molecule to another, of an electron, an atom or group of atoms to another.
            \n
            \n• Inadequate intake or absence of vitamin causes many diseases such as scurvy, rachitis etc.
            \n• Excessive intake of vitamins can also cause diseases such as hypervitaminosis, very toxic to the body.
            \n
            \nVitamin requirements are difficult to establish because they vary with the age, sex, size and muscular
            activity.
            \nThey increase during growth or diseases. In women, the need for vitamins increases during pregnancy and
            lactation.
        </item>
        <item>A virus is a biological entity that requires a host, usually a cell, for whom it uses the metabolism and
            its constituents to replicate and live.
        </item>
        <item>Phage or Bacteriophage are viruses that infect bacteria. They are usually very specific and often can
            infect only one species of bacteria.
            \n
            \nThis specificity is due to their mechanism of penetration into the bacterial cell: the phages recognize
            specific receptors on the bacterial surface which allow them to attach and inject their genetic material
            into the bacterium.
            \n
            \nPhages are unable to reproduce on their own. They do it by injecting their genetic material into a bacteria
            which has the enzymes and the ribosomes needed to replicate and translate its genetic information, the viral
            genome can therefore be translated and replicated to form many copies of the virus.
            \nThese viruses are then released from the bacteria by a host bacterium lysis mechanism, lysis being a
            membrane disintegrating mechanism of cell killing of the cell.
        </item>
        <item>An antibiotic is a natural or synthetic substance that blocks the growth or destroys bacteria.
            \n
            \nThey act specifically on bacteria by selectively blocking one step in an essential mechanism for their
            development and survival. (Synthesis of their wall, DNA, proteins, etc.)
            \nThis blocking occurs when the antibiotic binds to its target (receptor).
            \n
            \nThis interaction between the antibiotic and its target is very selective and specific bacteria.
